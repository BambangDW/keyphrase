===================================================

Obtaining
---------

To clone this repository:

	$ git clone http://github.com/alexbowe/keyphrase.git
	
This will create a directory `keyphrase` in your working directory. Note that this won't allow you to submit changes to the master repository.

Running
-------

You must have [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Dumbo](http://klbostee.github.com/dumbo/) installed. Just type:

    ./run.sh

This will copy the contents of the text folder to HDFS, and the results will be reformatted according to the assignment requirements and output to 3134434.out.

To run it in local Dumbo mode:

    ./run.sh -l

This is much faster than pseudo-distributed, and better for debugging.
